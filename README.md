Natural Language Intent Classification with TFLearn
This code is a simple demonstration of how to build a neural network model for the purpose of classifying user input into specific intents using TFLearn and NLTK.

Overview
The code processes an intents.json file, which contains patterns of user inputs and their corresponding intents or tags. Using the NLTK library, the code tokenizes and stems the input sentences to create a bag-of-words representation. This data is then fed into a neural network built using TFLearn to train the model. Once trained, the model is saved as model.tflearn.

Dependencies
NLTK
TFLearn
TensorFlow
NumPy
JSON
Setup
Install Dependencies:

Using pip, install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk tflearn tensorflow numpy
Prepare Data:

Ensure you have an intents.json file structured as follows:

json
Copy code
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": ["Hi", "How are you?", "Is anyone there?", "Hello", "Good day"]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
Usage
Train Model:

Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
This will tokenize the patterns, create a bag-of-words representation, train the model, and save it as model.tflearn.

Integration:

Integrate this model into chatbot applications, virtual assistants, or any tool where understanding user intent from their input is necessary.
