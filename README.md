# Natural Language Intent Classification with TFLearn

This code is a simple demonstration of how to build a neural network model for the purpose of classifying user input into specific intents using TFLearn and NLTK.

## Overview

The code processes an `intents.json` file, which contains patterns of user inputs and their corresponding intents or tags. Using the NLTK library, the code tokenizes and stems the input sentences to create a bag-of-words representation. This data is then fed into a neural network built using TFLearn to train the model. Once trained, the model is saved as `model.tflearn`.

## Dependencies

- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
- [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   Using pip, install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk tflearn tensorflow numpy

2. **Prepare Data**:
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": ["Hi", "How are you?", "Is anyone there?", "Hello", "Good day"]
        },
        ...
    ]
}


## Usage

### Train Model:

To start training the model, run the main script:

python your_script_name.py


This will tokenize the patterns, create a bag-of-words representation, train the model, and then save it as `model.tflearn`.

## Integration:
After training, you can integrate this model into applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or any other tool where understanding user intent from their input is required.
